Feel free to submit issues, pull requests, etc.!
When contributing code, please follow the general style expectations of Hyperion projects:
    - Follow the project .clang-format (except in judicious cases of templates or requires clauses ruining formatting),
    - Use trailing returns types,
    - Prefer assign-init (e.g. auto var = value;) over direct-init (e.g. auto var{value}),
    - By default, prefer simplicity and correctness over performance
